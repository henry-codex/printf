#printf
Hello Winifred,

I have created several files for our project, along with a README file. When you clone the repository, please make sure to do a git pull to get the files I have created.

In addition to my files, we need to create six more files for the project:

get_size.c

get_width.c

handle_print.c

main.h

utils.c

write_handlers.c

Please create these files and commit them to the repository. Thank you!
